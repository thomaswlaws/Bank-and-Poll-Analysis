# Python Analysis                        
  



## PyBank



* In this project, I created  a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a hypothetical company. 
The Python script analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The  final script also printed the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
 

## PyPoll


I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following for a small town's votes in an election:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.


  ```

The  final script also printed the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
